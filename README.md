# Predictive-Analytics-for-Greener-Energy-Transition
This is a project which explores different sustainable sources of energy in The Republic of Ireland with the data for renewable energy date - both production and consumption. There is prediction trends in the files shown.

Data Collection:
Energy Consumption Data: Collaborate with utility companies to access detailed energy consumption data. This data is crucial for accurate forecasting.
Identifying Data Requirements: Determine what types of data are necessary for accurate energy consumption forecasting. This includes economic, demographic, weather, and energy consumption data. Assess the availability of these data sources and any potential challenges in accessing them, especially utility consumption data.
Analytical and AI Approaches:
Machine Learning Techniques: Implement machine learning algorithms such as regression, time series analysis, and neural networks to forecast energy usage trends accurately.
Data Mining Techniques: Utilize data mining techniques to extract valuable patterns and insights from the collected data, aiding in forecasting energy consumption.
Stakeholder Engagement:
Interdisciplinary Team Collaboration: Engage with Environmental Scientists, Policy Analysts, Renewable Energy Specialists, Government Affairs Coordinators, Administrators, and Economists to ensure a comprehensive understanding of the project's goals and requirements.
Value Proposition: Clearly outline the purpose of the project, expected value, specific data collection requirements, and relevant machine learning approaches in the funding request to demonstrate the project's significance.
Utility Companies and Government Agencies: Highlight the potential benefits of the project for utility companies and other government agencies to motivate funding requests and showcase the broader impact of the initiative.
Proof-of-Concept Project:
Short-Term Analysis: Propose a short-term proof-of-concept project to identify the data required for the analysis. This will help estimate the cost of accessing the necessary data.
Forecasting Approach: Develop a forecasting approach that synthesizes the identified data sources to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the analytical and AI techniques in predicting energy consumption trends accurately.
Scientific Poster and Presentation:
Machine Learning Implementation: Showcase the implementation of machine learning and data mining techniques to address stakeholder needs effectively.
Business Leaders Presentation: Prepare a scientific poster and presentation that highlights the project's outcomes, insights, and recommendations for transitioning to renewable energy sources. Tailor the presentation to resonate with business leaders, emphasizing the strategic importance and potential benefits of the proposed national strategy.
Proof-of-Concept Project:
Short-Term Forecasting: Focus on a specific timeframe (e.g., next month, quarter) for initial analysis.
Machine Learning Techniques: Evaluate different algorithms suitable for time series forecasting:
Regression Models: Linear Regression, Random Forest Regression, XGBoost Regression can model relationships between historical data and future consumption.
Neural Networks: LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) networks are powerful for capturing temporal dependencies in energy consumption data.
Model Training and Evaluation: Split the data into training and testing sets. Train the models and evaluate their performance using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE).
Data Synthesis: Generate forecasts for future energy consumption using the chosen model(s).
Scientific Poster and Presentation:
Target Audience: Tailor the content for business leaders, focusing on the benefits and value proposition.
